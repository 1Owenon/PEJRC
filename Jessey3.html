                <p class = "par"> This was the most trying time in our relationship, we hadn't even gone anywhere and it looked like the time we never got to spend was put to an end. <br>
                    For the life of me, I did not want to experience that anymore.
                    <br> I hated everything about it, the uncertainty, the knowing I could wake up to a breakup message from a girlfriend i never got to propose to.
