                <p class = "par"> This was the magical part. I don't know if I ever told you this, but I was doing everything I could to see you. I'd come to Muna's class cause I know you'd be there, I'd intentionally walk by your hostel on my way to hilltop incase I saw you, but at the same time I did not want to be a bother(or a stalker).
                    <br>When we would see each other, I feel so happy, you make me warm, and I think we progressively opened up to each other. From the way you would hug me to the way you would look at me, I felt special.
                    <br>I remember the first time we kissed, I was scared to ask if I could kiss you and much more scared that you would look at me some type of way. but as you would know, I'm not the type to shy away from challenges. When you kissed me back, oh my days, my night was made, there and then, I knew I that this was a relationship I did not want to pass up on.
                    <br>From that day, we kept meeting and getting to know one aother.
