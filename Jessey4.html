                    Jessey, you are wonderful, you have made me fall in love, you have made me feel loved, and I have told you prior that you've made me want to be better. I love you so much, and although we still have our unresolved issues and unseen sides, I know that when those sides come, we would battle them together. I haven't done reltionships long enough to know what to do at most times, but I would try to be patient, learn, understand and be the person you can rely on when the going gets tough.
                    I have gotten to see the world from your eyes, I have spent time with you that I would cherish forever. I told you that this webpage was for a form I was working on. I want to make the whole thing better, but I don't have the time and you're on your way to a David'o concert rn.
                    <i>THE MOON LOOKS BEAUTIFUL TODAY</i>
                    <br> I like you a lot Jessey and I really really am praying we last all the way. So with this.
