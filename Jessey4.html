            Jessey, you have been wonderful, you have made me fall in love, you have made me feel loved, and i have told you prior that youve made me want to be better. I love you so much, and although we still have our unresolved issues and unseen sides, i knowthat when those siodes come, we would battle them together. I havent done reltionshipd long enough to know what to do at most times, but i would try to be patient, learn, understand and be the person you can rely on when the going gets tough.
            I like you a lot Jessey and i really really am praying we last all the way. So with this. 
        </p>
